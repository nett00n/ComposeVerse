# Gitea

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across all the platforms and architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. This project has been forked from Gogs since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit demo.gitea.com.

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit gitea.com.

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at cloud.gitea.com.
